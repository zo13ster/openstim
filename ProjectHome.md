# OpenStim #

OpenStim is an audio signal generation software written in Java. It is intended to serve as signal source for custom electrostimulation. While commercial [TENS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TENS) (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator) or [EMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_Muscle_Stimulation) (Electro Muscle Stimulation) devices offer only a small set of fixed patterns this software allows you to create almost every pattern you can imagine.

The purpose of electrostimulation is not only [pain control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_medicine) and relaxation, it also has [erotic aspects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_electrostimulation). However this software is only one part of the story, you will still need some hardware converting the generated audio signals into appropriate electric currents for electrostimulation.

Actually there are/were some projects around having the same or a similar purpose. Just to name some of them: BlackBox, [Phaser](http://phaser405.tripod.com/ihome.htm), RXTC, [SmartStim](http://www.smartstim.com/), StereoStim, Stimulus, TTG, [Wg32](http://allan_sydvall.tripod.com/). However most of these projects have shortcomings like being commercial, being available only for Windows, being non-extensible, being discontinued, and so on.

This project aims to be free from such shortcomings. It is written in Java and therefore fully cross-platform compatible. It is licensed under the GPL and therefore free to use for everyone, now and in the future. And since it is completely available in source code the project can be continued even if previous maintainers leave the project.

## Project Status ##

This project is in a very early state. The program is still in the prototyping phase. And although some parts of the GUI and some core routines already exist it is not yet really usable.
